Primitive Procedures
--------------------
Equality Procedures for boolean and string

procedures for strings:
string=?
string
string-length
string-ref
string-append

string->list
list->string

copy procedures

Make Lambda accept a variable number of arguments:

I. if only a single parameter is specified (not as a list)
then that parameter is bound to the list of arguments

e.g. ((lambda x x ) 3 4 5 6) ==> (3 4 5 6)
e.g. ((lambda (x y . z) z) 3 4 5 6) ==> (3 4 5 6)

II. if paramaters are specified followed by a period and one more,
the remaining arguments are bound as a list to the last parameter,
that is the list of args is improper and the end is the variadic
argument rather than the empty list

Decimal values

Optional:
Michaux did not implement type checking on the arguments
since by his consideration bootstrap shouldn't require it
since good input -> good output

maybe consider adding type checking?

Make car/cdr more efficient since most operations depend on these two primitives,
and currently they perform by casting every time they are performed

Garbage Collection
